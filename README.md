# ScrollViewInsetsWithToolbarTest
Test project to reproduce a scroll view indicator insets issue in isolation

## Differences to Rule Out ##

* View hierarchy different - scroll view contained within another view in problematic project
* view stood up in a Storyboard
* Test project is written in Swift?
